# Linear Search

In computer science, a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

Linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most `n` 
comparisons, where `n` is the length of the list.
