# Fibonacci number

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted `Fn`, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

For example:

`1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...`

A tiling with squares whose side lengths are successive Fibonacci numbers: `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21`.
